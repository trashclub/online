                    <p>What is the most eco-friendly way to throw away a strange object? By strange, we mean objects
                        that don’t belong (or would be harmful) in a landfill but also don’t fit into the category of
                        cardboard, plastic, paper, and metal of curbside recycling. Are there creative ways to
                        reuse this object if it can’t be recycled? By researching ecologically friendly
                        solutions of for discarding a strange object, we may discover an unexpected process to
                        reusing or recycling an object.

                        Pre-pandemic, Trash Club had the composting bin out on the 4th floor of 370 Jay St during our
                        Wednesday
                        snack
                        days. We would then drop off the compost bin at Borough Hall’s Greenmarket on Thursdays. Given
                        the remote situation we are currently in, Trash Club is figuring out other ways to support
                        composting efforts.
