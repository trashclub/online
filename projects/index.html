          <p>Born out of a curiosity to find the proper method of disposal for a tennis ball - Strange Objects is an
            ongoing workshop dedicated to researching, discovering, and mapping unexpected processes for discarding
            objects that may not fit into conventional waste categories. These strange objects may be the most banal
            and commonplace items but for some reason they fail to fit the commonly defined structures of waste
            infrastructure. In the workshop participants may find more ecologically friendly solutions for discarding
            their strange object of choice or they could learn of unexpected ways to reuse and repurpose the object to
            give it a new life. Through the workshop we hope people will develop a greater sense of curiosity towards the
            unique and complex processes that trash may go through before it can truly be defined as such.

          <p>
            The ongoing ITP compost project began on the 4th floor of 370 Jay St during our Wednesday
            snack day. Using two compost bins (one for food scraps and paper and the other for coffee grounds)
            we collected and weighed the contents weekly before dropping the compost off at Borough Hallâ€™s Thursday
            Greenmarket. As NYU is transitioning to a partially remote learning structure for the upcoming semester,
            Trash Club is working on ways to extend its compost program by supporting community compost efforts around
            NYC.
