          <p>For Trash Club’s inaugural photo and photogrammetry walk, we invite participants to practice
            <a href="https://medium.com/@the_jennitaur/how-to-do-nothing-57e100f59bbb" target="_blank">the art of noticing</a>
            as you stroll around your home and neighborhood. Your task will be to photograph or use
            <a href="https://3dscanexpert.com/beginners-guide-3d-scanning-photogrammetry/" target="_blank">photogrammetry</a>
            techniques to capture an everyday object in its second use.<br><br>

            Following an exercise presented by <a href="https://medium.com/re-form/how-to-pay-attention-4751adb53cb6" target="_blank">Rob Walker</a>,
            the purpose of this photo walk is not so much in the quality or quantity of the output, but rather, in seeing things you
            were not looking for. You may use digital or analog cameras. It may be interesting to use older cameras that require
            more time and patience in creating the photos, or even limiting yourself to taking a certain number of photos with a
            smartphone so that you can truly pay attention. Another possibility is to use photogrammetry techniques to document
            the objects. This can include the use of <a href="https://www.trnio.com/tutorial" target="_blank">3D scanning applications</a>
            on a phone/tablet, or more complex methods if you’d like.<br><br>

            The first theme for the photo walk is “the second life of objects.” The goal of this walk is to document objects
            that are in the state of reuse, disuse, or somewhere in between. This can include anything from a can repurposed as a planter
            to an abandoned TV on the sidewalk.<br><br>

            You can share your photos and photogrammetry captures with us on Instagram by tagging
            <a href="https://www.instagram.com/trashclub.online/" target="_blank">@trashclub.online</a> and
            using the hashtag: #TrashClubPhotoWalk. We will be collecting submissions until the end of this year, and will intermittently
            feature submissions on our Instagram. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to us at trashclub.online@gmail.com.

          <p>Born out of a curiosity to find the proper method of disposal for a tennis ball - Strange Objects is an
            ongoing workshop dedicated to researching, discovering, and mapping unexpected processes for discarding
            objects that may not fit into conventional waste categories. These strange objects may be the most banal
            and commonplace items but for some reason they fail to fit the commonly defined structures of waste
            infrastructure. In the workshop participants may find more ecologically friendly solutions for discarding
            their strange object of choice or they could learn of unexpected ways to reuse and repurpose the object to
            give it a new life. Through the workshop we hope people will develop a greater sense of curiosity towards the
            unique and complex processes that trash may go through before it can truly be defined as such.

          <p>
            The ongoing ITP compost project began on the 4th floor of 370 Jay St during our Wednesday
            snack day. Using two compost bins (one for food scraps and paper and the other for coffee grounds)
            we collected and weighed the contents weekly before dropping the compost off at Borough Hall’s Thursday
            Greenmarket. As NYU is transitioning to a partially remote learning structure for the upcoming semester,
            Trash Club is working on ways to extend its compost program by supporting community compost efforts around
            NYC.
