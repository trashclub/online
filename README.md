# Trash Club ... online!

## Instructions for local deployment:

If you don't have Ruby installed on your computer, run `brew install ruby` on Terminal. 

Next, you'll need to update your Ruby file path to the version you just installed. (To check what version, run `ruby -v`). Update by changing the **X.X** to the version number: `echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.gem/ruby/X.X.0/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile`

Then, we want to install **Bundler**, which helps us manage our Ruby environment and work with gems like Jekyll. (If you're more familiar with Python, it seems to play a similar role as **conda**, which helps you manage environments as well as installed packages.) At this point, you should be able to run this: 

`gem install --user-install bundler`

But, depending on your operating system, it might fail and you can run this instead: 

`sudo gem install bundler`

Then, navigate into this directory and run `bundle install`. This will install all the gems you need for our particular project. 

Finally, when you are ready to serve locally, run: `bundle exec jekyll serve`. The site will deploy to `http://127.0.0.1:4000`.
