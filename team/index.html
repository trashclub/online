          <p>Rashida is a curious nerd. She has worked as a data journalist, researcher, and game designer. She is a recent graduate of NYU ITP, where she built rotary phones that talked to the Library of Congress and pneumatic cakes that expelled edible glitter. She plans to continue as a post-doctoral fellow at ITP, where she intends to research how libraries act as vehicles for what is known, what is remembered, and what is forgotten. She loves a good supply chain story and enjoys making sense of a mess. </p>
