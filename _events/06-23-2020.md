title: "Teardown with Jasmine Soltani & Aaron Parsekian (Past)"
date: June 23, 2020
---

The workshop is focused on examining and practicing the deconstruction, maintenance, repair, and repurposing of electronics. Our session will consist of a live teardown led by NYU ITP alumni Jasmine Soltani and Aaron Parsekian. The second half of the workshop will be focused on investigating the origins, materials and geographical implications of the components within the disassembled device. Through this investigation we will better understand the complex and global supply network involved in the making of our digital devices.

The text that we will discuss and refer to in our teardown sessions include:
