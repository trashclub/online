Julia Rich (they/them) is an interdisciplinary artist and educator living and working in Los Angeles, CA. Currently, they are an educator for UCLA’s Geffen Academy and help run their makerspace, as well as teach fabrication, project management, programming, and physical computation. Outside of UCLA, Julia creates art and workshops exploring gender identity, transformative arts practices, and community building.
In this workshop, Julia will be demonstrating sustainable practice for prototyping with found items and cardboard, shifting the framework of what might be considered “trash”.
