Ever wondered about what happens to the things we recycle in NYC? Find out at the Sims Municipal Recycling Facility virtual tour. At Sims, you can see how our recycled material is acquired, broken down, filtered, categorized, and then sold for reuse. The facility opened in 2003, and is the first of its kind in NYC, sorting through about 500,000 tons of metal, glass, paper, and plastic each year. More information about Sims can be found [here](https://www.simsmunicipal.com/about/).
