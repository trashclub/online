title: "Strange Objects Workshop"
date: June 12, 2020

For this workshop, please bring in a strange object to investigate and document. By strange object we mean objects that don’t belong (or would be harmful) in a landfill but also don’t fit into the recycling categories of cardboard, plastic, paper, and metal. During this workshop, we will research, write and visualize the process of how our chosen strange object can best be recycled or reused, if at all. We will first research how this object is typically thrown away and its impact in landfills, then we will search for more ecological ways of discarding this object. This week's workshop will be covering the following text:
