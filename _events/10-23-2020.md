Please note that this workshop requires advance registration on Eventbrite, as participants will receive workshop materials by mail.

The E Waste 2.0 Team invites participants to dive into “e” wastes in progress with special attention to logistics infrastructure. Drawing from Jennifer Gabrys’ observation that, “...the margins where trash is shifted or held are not necessarily sharply delineated but overlap and intersect. Electronics are left on curbsides and in skips, packaged in closets, bundled up in warehouses. These peripheral sites are often actually central but invisible,” this workshop is formulated to work with and through practices and processes of selection, refinement, enclosure, obfuscation, and disappearance that form the materiality and performative capacity of e waste as it moves through historical and political lineages of mobility. Rather than tear down or break apart one discarded object through which to conduct an investigation, we will treat global discard systems as the overarching object through which we can study via fragments. These fragments include materials, objects, and packages at different stages within the discard pipeline. Together we will try to orient ourselves within the confusion and chaos of these systems through exercises like sorting, somatic movement, and playful discussion.
