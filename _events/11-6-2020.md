[Interference Archive](https://interferencearchive.org/) will be hosting a virtual walk through of their climate justice exhibition and talk a little about the archive and the materials they collect. 

[A Visual History of Climate Justice](https://interferencearchive.org/like-the-waters-we-rise-climate-justice-in-print/) is an exhibition that includes a collection of archival prints documenting the historical struggles that gave birth to the current climate justice movement. These materials—from the anti-nuclear movement, Indigenous sovereignty movement, Black liberation struggles, the farmworker justice movement, and more—illustrate that the climate movement is made of many movements and one that encompasses many terrains of struggle.
