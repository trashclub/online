[Cy Kim](https://www.cy-kim.com/) is a designer with a specialization in fabrication research. [Bobby Esposito](https://www.bobbyesposito.com/) is a licensed architect with expertise in digital fabrication, virtual environments and computational design. Cy and Bobby will be talking about their design work as well as their Plastic Pavilion research project that sought to prove the potential of a material that is usually considered waste. They researched, consulted experts, experimented, figured out a process for re-purposing polypropylene cups and built an inhabitable pavilion. Regarding Plastic Pavilion, Cy has written that “the main issue with plastic waste is that it is imperishable, whether it is in a landfill, ocean or elsewhere. In a different context, this can be an advantage.”
