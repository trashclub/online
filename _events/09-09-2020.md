title: "Fall Book Club â€“ Toxic Communities"
date: September 09, 2020
---

Every Other Wednesday at 8p ET, beginning Wednesday, September 9 We are launching our inaugural book club to give our members the opportunity to read something that is both longer and greater in depth together. We will begin with Toxic Communities by Dorceta E. Taylor. In this text, Taylor offers a portrait of the environmental justice movement, illustrating how minorities, the poor, and marginalized groups suffer injustices at the hands of profit-seeking businesses and government. Taylor utilizes economic theories, social justice critiques and specific case studies to traverse the contours of environmental racism. We will discuss chapters 1 & 2 this Wednesday.

You can access a [PDF of the book](https://www.are.na/block/3488677) on our [are.na page](https://www.are.na/trash-club). Our events and book club are open to the public, so please feel free to pass along these details to other individuals who may be interested.
