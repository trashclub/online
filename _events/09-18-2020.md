Julie Lizardo is a second year student at NYU Interactive Telecommunications Program [ITP] and a course assistant at NYU's Department of Computer Science. One of her life-long goals is to promote computer science education as well as sustainable practices in disadvantaged and underrepresented communities. This past spring, she participated in the Biodesign Challenge Summit 2020 with her project, Amber. Amber is a plant-based, waterproof biomaterial made out of rice husks and pine resin. It provides a natural alternative to plastic as well as gives agency to Hispanic and Latino community members to help eliminate food waste in their daily practices. You can learn more about Amber [here](https://lizardoajulie.wixsite.com/amber), and at our speaker series.
