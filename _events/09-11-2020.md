In remembrance of 9/11 and its aftermath, Trash Club will be screening an oral history interview of Martin Bellow, one of the NYC Department of Sanitation leaders in charge of the city’s response. Martin oversaw the process of removing the debris from the World Trade Center and transporting it to Fresh Kills Landfill on Staten Island. The series comes from NYU Professor Robin Nagle’s 2011 graduate seminar, [Oral History, Labors of Waste, and the Value of Knowledge](https://www.dsnyoralhistoryarchive.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/OH-Syllabus-Sp11.pdf), .
