[Ingrid Burrington](http://lifewinning.com/) writes, makes maps, and tells jokes about places, politics, and the feelings people have about both. Sheâ€™s the author of [Networks of New York: An Illustrated Field Guide to Urban Internet Infrastructure](https://www.mhpbooks.com/books/networks-of-new-york/). Ingrid will be detailing her current research into mining tailings and more specifically the burgeoning economy of extracting rare earth materials from tailings created at coal mines across Appalachia. There are many contrasts to this process; from the financial support that this new form of work could give to support local economies to the environmental contamination imposed by tailings potentially being made worse. A few suggested readings will be sent out before the talk for everyone to unpack together during the second half of the talk.
