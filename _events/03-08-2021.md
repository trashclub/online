Co-founder Morgan Mueller will be presenting his own research from his master’s thesis:

“The nuclear [fuel chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fuel_cycle) is a complex and often opaque process which involves actors from multiple scales. National governments vie for the right to extract uranium across the global south while laborers face the toxic aftermath of extraction. Western Countries are not truly distanced from the disastrous processes used to create their energy, the nuclear fuel chain has created a global entanglement where power, in multiple senses of the word, is not distributed equally. By creating a series of artifacts around the global nuclear fuel chain, I introduce complexities of the nuclear world's political ecologies through [supply chain mapping](https://nuclearsystem.live/pages/artifacts.html#anchor-section1). I look at knowledge gaps and colonial power dynamics through the use of publicly available [records](https://nuclearsystem.live/pages/artifacts.html#anchor-section3) and [satellite imagery](https://nuclearsystem.live/pages/artifacts.html#anchor-section2). Finally this project looks at the current [nuclear waste](https://nuclearsystem.live/pages/artifacts.html#anchor-section4) landscape and proposes a reimagining of the above ground spent [nuclear fuel cask](https://nuclearsystem.live/pages/artifacts.html#anchor-section5) as the apparatus for the memorialization of nuclear waste.”
